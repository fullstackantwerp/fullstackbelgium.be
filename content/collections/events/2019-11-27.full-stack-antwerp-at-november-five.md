    talk_title: 'From clipboard to computer screen - using AI to analyse film scripts'
    abstract: '<div>In recent years artificial intelligence has been implemented in a variety of industries such as healthcare, finance, education, etc. But can it be used in the film industry?<br>As a rule of thumb one page in a screenplay will translate to one minute on the screen. As part of the pre production process a script supervisor goes through the script and acts out the entire film to estimate the timings per scene. Can we use machine learning to automate this estimation? By creating a regression algorithm to predict scene timings I will explain some key concepts like regression, feature selection, pipelines, cross validation,â€¦ along the way.</div>'
    bio: '<div>Rik Boeykens is a full stack developer for The Master Labs, where he mostly works with .Net and Angular. In a previous life he worked in the film industry, and he still loves watching and analysing movies.</div>'

    talk_title: 'Serverless architecture applied'
    abstract: '<div>In this presentation we go over the serverless architecture that backs Radio Winokio, a Spotify-like app for iOS and Android that bundles the music of Kapitein Winokio. We intentionally chose a mix of AWS and Google Firebase services that served our needs best. The presentation mainly focuses on file security, caching and cost reduction measures we took and how we automated the creation of the infrastructure using Terraform.</div>'
    bio: '<div>After graduating from KDG (Multimedia &amp; Communication Technology), Joren started his career as PHP Developer at November Five. Since then, he gained expertise in Symfony, AWS and recently moved to Serverless using Python. He is currently working as Serverside &amp; Devops Engineer.<br>He has developed platforms amongst others, for Brussels Airport, SD Worx and Coca Cola.</div>'
