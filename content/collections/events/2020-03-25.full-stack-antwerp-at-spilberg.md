We developers tend to stay away from this world and its processes. Yet, like those who fulfill these roles, we have the same end-goal in mind, a great product for our end-users. A User Experience Designer will combine the UX and UI research to get to a beautiful and useful end product. But how exactly do they get this result?

Obviously, PHP has long evolved into the powerful and popular language it is today. Yet, it can sometimes still be hard to fend off the misconceptions. WordPress has gone through a similar ordeal. Lately, behind the scenes, it''s not as old and rusty as you might expect! Used correctly, it can neatly serve some purposes. In this lightning talk, I''ll share a glimpse of the coolest parts that get me excited and proud to have WordPress in my toolbox!<br><br>By Koen Van den Wijngaert - Freelance consultant <br><br><strong>10) CI/CD for mobile applications with Gitlab<br></strong><br>Howto quickly setup a CI/CD system for Android and iOS based apps with Gitlab.<br><br>By Nathan Samson - Founder Lead Developer of Beeple</div>'
