    abstract: '<div>ACPaaS UI - why we made and open-sourced a front-end framework by Joeri Sebrechts<br><br>What if you had to deliver software to run many aspects of the daily life of more than half a million people? This is the particular challenge that Digipolis must solve for the city of Antwerp. It is that challenge that has led us to develop our own front-end framework called ACPaaS UI, built on top of Angular and React. This talk covers the why and how of this framework, the lessons learned along the way, and where we want to take it in the future.<br><br>Speaker: Joeri is a digital experience platform architect at Digipolis, working on elements of their ACPaaS city platform. Across his career as a software developer he has come into contact with many technologies and domains, from IOT to Big Data and most things in between. He considers himself an information addict and is always happy to learn new things.<br><br>Length: 45min</div>'

    abstract: '<div>It''s a DevOps world after all by Tom Moors<br><br>In 2009, the talk "10+ deploys a day" at Flickr ignited a whole new movement that got known as DevOps. Ten years later, we meet here just in time to make our New Year''s resolutions. In this talk we''ll revisit the foundations and dive into good, the bad (and even some ugly) practices to truly make in impact in 2019 - who wants to be a 10x developer if you can be a part of 100x team!<br><br>Speaker: Tom Moors is a 32 year old software engineer who spends his days improving the way how teams work together, mainly fueled by Atlassian tools. When the evening falls, he turns into a young father of 2 girls. Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/tommoors">@tommoors</a><br><br>Length: 30min</div>'
