    talk_title: 'Programming with pure functions'
    abstract: '<div>Functional programming is taking the world by storm and with it comes the notion of programming with pure functions. We''ll explore how this insight can help us build better software by improving how we reason about our programs. By learning about the mathematics of functions we''ll build an intuition for thinking functionally, but we''ll stay away from difficult mathematical notation or jargon. All code examples used in the talk will be in TypeScript, although we will stick to easy examples. No prerequisite knowledge of mathematics is required. The talk will introduce the concepts of Sets and Functions.</div>'
    bio: '<div>Janne is an independent software consultant at Siera Solutions, he has multiple years of experience and currently works with F#/C#/TypeScript. He loves to learn about new ideas and apply them to create value in real-world projects. His latest avenue of exploration has brought him to functional programming and category theory.</div>'

In this talk we will take a look at how we can leverage the cloud to build a modern application, different ways to pick components and why we should keep evolving our architecture.</div>'
