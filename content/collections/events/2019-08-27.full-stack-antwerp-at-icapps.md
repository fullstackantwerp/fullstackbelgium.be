    talk_title: 'Presentation Skills for Programmers'
    abstract: '<div>Whether it''s sharing in a weekly status-report stand-up, presenting at a Meetup group, or speaking at a Conference, most people find themselves anxious to some degree, or even downright terrified. Or maybe you have some presentation ideas but aren''t sure if *you* could be a speaker.<br><br>In this talk we''ll discuss several presentation skills, including reducing nervousness, communicating in 2nd languages, validating ideas, minimizing distracting behaviours, and how to prepare for a Lightning or Un-Conference talk. Lots of other tips will be thrown in along the way, including smart choices for slide preparation, starting and ending smoothly, and even handling Q&amp;A.</div>'
