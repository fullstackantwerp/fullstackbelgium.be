    talk_title: 'Building a DSL with GraalVM'
    abstract: '<div>GraalVM is a virtual machine that can run many languages on top of the Java Virtual Machine. It comes with support for JavaScript, Ruby, Python… But what if you’re building a DSL, or your language is not listed? Fear not!<br><br>In this session we’ll discover what it takes to run another language in GraalVM. Using GraalVM, we don’t only get a fast runtime, but we’ll also get great tool support. With Brainfuck as an example, we’ll see how we can run guest languages inside Java applications. It might not bring us profit, but at least it will bring some fun.</div>'
