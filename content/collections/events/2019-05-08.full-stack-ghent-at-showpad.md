    talk_title: 'Video streaming acceleration with Varnish'
    abstract: '<div>Most of us know Varnish as the web acceleration software that is used to make your site bullet-proof. But Varnish can do more than speed up your website.<br><br>In this presentation, Thijs will show you how video streaming over HTTP works and how Varnish can be used to scale your OTT video platform.<br><br>The goal is to offload as much as we can from our origin servers. Not only the video streaming itself, but also a lot of the advanced decision making such as:<br><br></div><ul><li>Pre-fetching the next video segments</li><li>Geo-blocking and geo-routing</li><li>Rate limiting</li><li>Response body manipulation</li><li>Dynamic backend selection</li></ul><div><br>Thijs will package an MP4 file into HLS and MPEG-DASH and accelerate its delivery, but we’ll also measure the performance improvement for a video we’ll stream live.</div>'

    talk_title: 'Supercharging Common Controllers'
    abstract: '<div>A while ago I had to create a fairly complicated CRUD interface from scratch. While this isn’t rocket science, there surprisingly aren’t that many good resource out there on how to do this. That’s why our team dove in and published a couple of packages that can help create modern CRUD interface. In this highly practical talk you’ll learn how we nowadays go about creating a CRUD interface at Spatie. We’ll take a look at how we can convert url parameters to a Eloquent query. You’ll learn what view models are. We’ll create some server side components with BladeX and much more.</div>'
