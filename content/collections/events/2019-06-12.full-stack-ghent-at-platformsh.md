    abstract: '<div>The AWS platform has a bunch of services&nbsp; to make your application "serverless". We will take a look at what defines something to be serverless and how we can leverage services like AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway and S3 to build our own applications to be cost-effective, scalable and highly-available.</div>'

    talk_title: 'Beyond Twelve Factor Apps with PaaS'
    abstract: '<div><a href="https://12factor.net">The original 12 factors</a> set a great baseline for writing secure apps that were maintainable. With the rise of cloud native applications, more thought has to be given to application design to take advantage of new tools while still preserving and enhancing security and maintainability.&nbsp; Many of these considerations can be delivered by the underlying tools, however, and this talk delves into some of the key benefits that can be gained by electing to develop and deploy on a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).<br><br>These include:<br><br></div><ul><li>Deploying infrastructure through code]</li><li>Disposability of builds</li><li>Dependency management</li><li>Environmental configuration</li><li>Authentication and authorization</li><li>Statefulness vs Statelessness</li></ul>'
    bio: '<div>After 2 years as a web developer, mostly working on Symfony/OroCrm for a Parisian startup, Duncan moved to Platform as a Partner Delivery Manager and recently joined the Customer Solution Architect team.</div>'
