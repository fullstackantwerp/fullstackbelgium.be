    abstract: '<div>Software Engineering is undoubtedly one of the best-paid jobs nowadays. The latter implies that the market for Software Engineers is quite big, so there are always quite a few opportunities for all levels of expertise. However, when a market is big it means it''s not always that easy to find good Engineers; because in the end, this is what companies want: exceptional Engineers. Are you happy enough with your current position? Do you often find yourself in dilemmas like "am I doing the right thing?", "should I change something?", "how can I improve my skills?", "how could I be seen as a strong technical person?" ?<br><br>Except for answering the aforementioned questions, this session will actually help you to:<br><br>- market yourself as you never did before<br>- drive your career in the direction you want<br>- keep being motivated to become better and better<br>- improve your productivity<br>- take the right decisions at the right time</div>'
