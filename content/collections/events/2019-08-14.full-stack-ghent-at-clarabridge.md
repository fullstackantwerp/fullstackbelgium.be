    talk_title: 'Have your cake and eat it too with Inertia.js'
    abstract: '<div>One of the harder choices we need to make as web developers in 2019 is how we want to build our app''s frontend.<br><br>Do we want to stick with Blade for templating? Do we want to build a SPA? SPA''s sound cool but then we''ll need an API and use some fancy authentication protocol. We still might want a SPA though, since that''d allow us to provide a richer user experience. Decisions are hard!<br><br>Let''s take a step back. Instead of choosing between the two ends of the spectrum, why not combine them and have the best of both worlds? That''s where Inertia.js makes its appearance. Inertia.js is a framework for creating server-driven single page apps. With Inertia.js, we can build an app that keeps business and data concerns on the server, with a JavaScript powered view layer.<br><br>In this talk, we''ll review the tradeoffs when making a choice between keeping complexity on the server or on the client. Then we''ll demonstrate what an app looks like built with Laravel, Vue.js and Inertia.js. We''ll start with `laravel new`, and work towards a working application.</div>'

    talk_title: 'I just became team-lead, now what'
    abstract: '<div>Today was a good day; you just got promoted as team-lead of your development team. The details weren''t all that clear, but the boss told you: "You''ll figure it out on the job."<br><br>You know there will be some extra responsibilities like taking the lead in job interviews, talking to potential customers, keeping the stack up to date... You don''t want to let your team down, and there are a lot of eyes on you.<br><br>It might be best to avoid some pitfalls.<br><br>In this talk, we will take a look at how you can keep the team motivated and inspired, see if we can apply the same mindset to job interviews and dive into some do''s and don''t of talking to customers. You''re going to do great, but a little guidance never hurt anyone.</div>'
