    talk_title: 'Front End & OpenAPI: Define, generate, develop'
    abstract: '<div>As a developer, working with REST API dependencies ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. Security implications, parallel development, time or budget restrictions for writing documentation, …, in an enterprise you might not always have the ability to rely on your REST API dependencies for development, let alone for an automated testing environment.<br><br>The OpenAPI ecosystem offers us solutions in the form of virtually complete independence from a REST API during development and testing.<br><br>Maarten will guide you through a high-level overview of what the OpenAPI spec. is, how it can benefit front end development and how to use an automated OpenAPI mocking server in a test suite.</div>'
    bio: '<div>If I say Java, you say Script! Together with his fellow front end developers, Maarten raises ISAAC’s JavaScript and CSS bar to a whole new level. With tools such as Vue.js, Nuxt.js and OpenAPI in his proverbial tool belt, he builds modern web projects that excel in speed and usability. Maarten’s in his happy place is when he’s working on isomorphic applications, projects where one single JavaScript code base can be run on a server as well as on the client. It’s iso-morphing time! <a href="http://mrtnvh.com">http://mrtnvh.com</a> <a href="http://isaac.nl">http://isaac.nl</a></div>'

    talk_title: 'Vertically Integrated REST'
    abstract: '<div>In this talk I will focus on end-to-end REST services. From building them to securing them to optimizing them with client and server based caching. However we go beyond the backend and look at how we can consume our automatically generated swaggers in the frontend. As a final piece of the puzzle we look at REST composition which offers an alternative to GraphQL but with the advantages of REST.</div>'
    bio: '<div>Over the past 10 years Alexander has focused on finding new innovative ways to build software, breaking away from the traditional approaches. Powered by Java in the backend and VueJS in the frontend, the end result is a flexible low-code platform that massively accelerates software creation.</div>'
