    talk_title: 'CI/CD with Azure DevOps Pipelines - How to setup your pipeline in a couple of minutes?'
    abstract: '<div>This talk is about setting up your CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps Pipelines following a real-world example at Rombit (we are deprecating our Jenkins infra, aww). We will focus on a frontend pipeline with React but will also show quickly how it can be done for other key components of your application. Deploying to Kubernetes in a couple of minutes! It''s possible.<br><br>Azure Pipelines is a fully-featured continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) service. It works with your preferred Git provider and can deploy to most major cloud services, which include Azure services. Start with your code on GitHub, GitHub Enterprise Server, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud, or Azure Repos. Then you can automate the build, testing, and deployment of your code to Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or Amazon Web Services.</div>'

    talk_title: 'Journey to painless releases - Continuous delivery for Philips Hue Android'
    abstract: '<div>Wind back one year ago:<br><br>- releasing took us 10 weeks<br>- our app was plagued by regression<br>- developers felt completely detached from our users<br><br>Clearly our traditional strategy of heavily testing each release (up-front quality) wasn''t working. So we decided to flip things around: why not try to reduce the cost of errors instead? Hence we decided to move our Philips Hue Android app to continuous deployment.<br><br>In this talk, you will learn that if releasing is painful, you should actually release it even more often. Step by step I''ll explain how we moved the Philips Hue Android app to continuous deployment, what our current release process/CI looks like, what changes we made to our overall testing approach, how we empowered developers and testers, and how we made our release process completely painless.</div>'
    bio: '<div>Jeroen has a real passion to build things, which continuously challenges him to experiment and learn. In the process, he refocussed his master in Electrical engineering to become an Android developer. Starting off with highly technical prototypes for Wi-Fi connected products, he has built his own file-sharing platform (Wi-FileTransfer). He is a Google Developer Expert in Android GDE and former Lead Android developer at Philips Hue.<br><br>One of a kind, never-been-done-before apps are what he enjoys most. So far Jeroen helped realize four huge connected products, various high profile apps, actively contributes to open source and loves interacting with the Android community. He is a passionate blogger and enjoys speaking at conferences.</div>'
