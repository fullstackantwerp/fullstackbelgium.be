    talk_title: 'Understanding Git'
    abstract: '<div>Git is a standard tool for version control these days so we all use it daily. And we all understand it. Or do we? Well...<br><br>Let''s face it - git is hard. And the main reason it is hard is because it''s UI is full of leaky abstractions. That is why in order to get comfortable with git you need to gain some understanding of how git works "under the hood".<br><br>In this talk we do just that - "open" git''s hood and take a look at what happens there when we do our daily operations.</div>'
    bio: '<div>Zvonimir is a passionate software developer coming from Croatia but with current base in Berlin, Germany. Don''t ask him anything in German yet though, he''s still working on his sprachen-skills.<br><br></div><div>As a developer, he is highly interested in software architecture and ‘getting it right’. Outside work, he likes to keep his mind sharp and body strong by doing different recreational sports. Zvone enjoys reading a good book, listening to all sorts of music and chillin'' with his dogs.</div>'

    talk_title: 'Going Serverless with Google Cloud Run'
    abstract: '<div>Cloud Run is a fully managed compute platform by Google that automatically scales stateless containers. By abstracting away all infrastructure management, us developers can focus on what matters most: building great applications. In this talk I''ll show you not only how to deploy PHP/Node applications onto Cloud Run, but also how to create a build pipeline using either Google Cloud Build or Github Actions.</div>'
    bio: '<div>Bram(us) Van Damme is a freelance developer from Belgium. From the moment he discovered the web way back in 1997, he fell in love with it and has been tinkering with it ever since.<br><br>With his company 3RDS he focuses on frontend development (HTML, CSS, JS), but he can also tackle the backend (PHP, MySQL) and related technologies (DNS, Docker, Serverless, etc.).
