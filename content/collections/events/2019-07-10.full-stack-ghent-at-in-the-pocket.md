    talk_title: 'The Sequel to NoSQL'
    abstract: '<div>The past years we''ve seen a lot of changes in the database landscape. First there was the rise of NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Cassandra, then there was a revenge of the SQL, with Postgres capturing a lot of the mindshare, and now we''re seeing both traditional SQL and novel NoSQL databases challenged by even newer distributed SQL databases like Google Spanner, CockroachDB and YugabyteDB. Come take a look under the covers of these databases to learn about their architectures and trade-offs, and discover how to navigate this increasingly complicated landscape.</div>'

    talk_title: 'The Road to Painless Deployment'
    abstract: '<div>Writing code is only one piece of the puzzle when creating and delivering an application. This code has to be continuously deployed and monitored. Managing deployments and setting up the cloud environment is often a time consuming process. Especially when introducing multiple environments and the configuration has to be reused. This is where Infrastructure As Code comes in to play. In this talk i will elaborate how we handle deployments and infrastructure at In The Pocket.</div>'
    bio: '<div>Matthias is Cloud Architect at In The Pocket, working on projects for several big clients such as Barco and Daikin. Most projects I was involved in, featured both frontend and backend components.</div>'
