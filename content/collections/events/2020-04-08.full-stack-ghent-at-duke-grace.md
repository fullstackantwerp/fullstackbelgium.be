    abstract: '<div>A session about accessible software for people with a disability. As developer you can develop apps, to help people with a disability. It’s a sector that is not often covered by developers. But with a little set of developer skills you can make lives better. First of all we start with the description of the field of people with a disability, which disabilities are there? What are the problems? After this I describe how people with disabilities are threaten in the past and today. Then I describe how software can help inclusion. I talk you about inclusive design and develop patterns. I end with slides how people in normal work situations can benefit of the power of persons with different kind of disabilities.</div>'

    talk_title: 'Ownership of the benefits of development'
    abstract: '<div>The gap between business and developers is not new, it''s been there as long as IT exists. Yet, we seem to have a hard time closing this gap. Customers often know what they want and, as developers, we tend to dive right into the solution immediately. We are problem solvers and we have the latest, coolest technologies to build a solution for everything. Because of all this enthusiasm, we sometimes forget to stop and think about the problem. Why does the customer asks for a certain project, feature ,…? Do we really need to build a whole new application to solve their problem?&nbsp;<br><br>Customers should be the "owner of the benefit", which requires them to be heavily involved. But how do we make sure that they are part of the development team? And how can we make sure that we both work towards a common goal?<br><br>In this talk, I will share my lessons learned about bridging the gap, learning how to listen and to speak a common language.</div>'
    bio: '<div>I''m Sanne Vermeiren, scrum master for the Flemish child allowance project "Groeipakket".&nbsp;I''ve discovered my passion for technology right after I had received my applied economics degree. After three months of intensive coding training, I started working on my current project. In 2019, I became Young ICT Lady which gives me the opportunity to share my passion for technology with young girls and kick stereotypes ass. Currently I''m trying to learn more about Docker, microservices and domain driven design. My ultimate goal is to be able to explain these technologies and concepts in a way that a non-technical customer can understand what the developers are talking about.</div>'
